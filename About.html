      <h3>A Glimpse Into My Coding World</h3>
      <br />
        <p>
          I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student with a strong
          interest in web development and software engineering. My journey in
          coding started with a curiosity to understand how websites and
          applications work, which quickly evolved into a deep love for creating
          digital solutions. Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, and I continue to explore new
          technologies and frameworks. My approach to learning is hands-on, as I
          believe that the best way to master a skill is by building real-world
          projects. Whether it's designing a user-friendly website or optimizing
          the performance of a web application, I am always eager to take on new
          challenges and expand my knowledge. With a strong foundation in
          computer science and a passion for innovation, I am committed to
          contributing to the tech community and making a positive impact
          through my work.
